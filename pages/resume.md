## **Experience**

#### Digital Editor

**[Reveal](http://revealnews.org), The Center for Investigative Reporting**

*Emeryville, CA – January 2015 - Present*

Julia develops and oversees editorial projects that shape how stories and investigations are published across platforms. Her job combines reporting with technology, web and audio production. 

She's led the production of digital content for 67 [Reveal episodes](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes) – and counting. She works collaboratively with teams across the organization to make decisions on publishing and engagement strategies for stories, shows and Reveal's larger investigations. Some of this work is then packaged for and distributed to 393 stations across the country in an effort to share assets, reporting and data for local stories, and serves as a general digital lift for stations.

Julia works with other editors to identify new ways to tell stories and engage the audience on the investigations Reveal produces. In 2016, she used [Juxtapose.js](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) in an offbeat way to "[Decode the language of discrimination](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/decoding-the-language-of-discrimination/);" she [learned key lessons](http://www.poynter.org/2016/4-lessons-from-reveals-serialized-instagram-investigation/428047/) from publishing [Reveal's first Instagram investigation](https://www.revealnews.org/article/bad-deals-the-perils-of-bargaining-for-justice/); found compelling ways to use audio, collected or produced during the radio production process, online (Examples [1](https://www.revealnews.org/article/portraits-of-a-trump-supporter/), [2](https://twitter.com/juliachanb/status/761687005826732032) and [3](https://www.revealnews.org/article/caught-on-tape-the-presidential-edition/)); and created a holistic campaign to engage audience members across platforms about Super Pacs.

She nurtured and cultivated strategic partnerships – with orgs like [Soundcloud](http://cironline.org/blog/post/what-does-news-sound-techraking-four-looks-clouds-5396) and [Google](http://cironline.org/blog/post/join-our-live-coverage-cirs-techraking-conference-toronto-6193) – for collaborations and events.
