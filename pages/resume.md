#### Digital Editor

**[Reveal, The Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.revealnews.org/)**

*Emeryville, Calif. – July 2014 - June 2017*

Julia develops and oversees editorial projects that shape how stories and investigations are published across platforms. Her job combines reporting with technology, web and audio production. 

She's led the production of digital content for [95 Reveal episodes](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes) and counting. She works collaboratively with teams across the organization to make decisions on publishing and engagement strategies for stories, shows and Reveal's larger investigations. Some of this work is then packaged for and distributed to 402 stations across the country in an effort to share assets, reporting and data for local stories, and serves as a general digital lift for stations.

Julia works with other editors to identify new ways to tell stories and engage the audience on the investigations Reveal produces. In 2016, she used [JuxtaposeJS](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) in an offbeat way to "[Decode the language of discrimination](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/decoding-the-language-of-discrimination/);" she [learned key lessons](http://www.poynter.org/2016/4-lessons-from-reveals-serialized-instagram-investigation/428047/) from publishing [Reveal's first Instagram investigation](https://www.revealnews.org/article/bad-deals-the-perils-of-bargaining-for-justice/); found compelling ways to use audio, collected or produced during the radio reporting process, online (Examples [1](https://www.revealnews.org/article/portraits-of-a-trump-supporter/), [2](https://twitter.com/juliachanb/status/761687005826732032) and [3](https://www.revealnews.org/article/caught-on-tape-the-presidential-edition/)); and created a holistic campaign to engage audience members across platforms ([radio/podcast](https://soundcloud.com/thisisreveal/unpacking-super-pacs#t=11:44), [social video](https://www.facebook.com/ThisIsReveal/videos/1031704153587169/?hc_ref=SEARCH) and [website](https://www.revealnews.org/article/pop-quiz-unpacking-super-pacs/)) about Super Pacs. 

Reveal's radio show is broadcast by all of the 10 major markets. 

In November, Reveal's podcast hit one million downloads a month and in April, it reached more than 1.6 million downloads. Two-thirds of Reveal podcast listeners are between the ages of 18 to 34 – this is almost twice the [national average](http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Podcast-Consumer-2016.pdf).

She nurtured and cultivated strategic partnerships – with organizations like [Soundcloud](http://cironline.org/blog/post/what-does-news-sound-techraking-four-looks-clouds-5396) and [Google](http://cironline.org/blog/post/join-our-live-coverage-cirs-techraking-conference-toronto-6193) – for collaborations and events. She also provided support and consultation to the Director of Events for [Techraking](https://www.revealnews.org/events-page/techraking/), CIR's mini-conference series dedicated to pairing journalists with innovators.

She also helped to develop "[Reveal Radio](http://revealradio.org/tag/09-28-2013/)" when it was just a glimmer in [Joaquin's eye](http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/reveal_and_the_new_push_for_po.php).
