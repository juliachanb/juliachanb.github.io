### Interactive: For disabled patients, an endless cycle of abuse

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/article/interactive-for-disabled-patients-an-endless-cycle-of-abuse/)

*This interactive accompanied Reveal and New Hampshire Public Radio’s [larger investigation](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/a-mountain-of-misconduct/) into the history of abuse and neglect at a network of family-run neurorehab centers. It takes a deeper look at the major players uncovered while reporting the story, and displays their connections with one another.*

*I worked with developer Julia Smith to conceptualize the design and functionality of the interactive, and artist Anna Vignet on the illustrations. I also worked closely with lead reporters Laura Starecheski and NHPR’s Jack Rodolico to write and edit the graphic's narrative. One of my goals for this project was to make sure that each character's story stood well alone and as a slice of the larger piece.*

*Bonus: An [iframed version](http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/apps-staging-cironline-org/lakeview-timeline/index.html) of the timeline was distributed to 200+ radio stations to include on their websites alongside the radio investigation.*

*Along with the digital pieces that accompanied this episode, I produced the opening segment and provided production assistance for Katherine Mieszkowski's salmonella story.*

*I researched and interviewed workers at the San Francisco Wholesale Produce marketplace, conducted field recordings, prepped host Al Letson on the scene, wrote the scripts and worked with engineer Jim Briggs to produce the story in Pro Tools.*

The illustrations show the different punishments religious daycares were found to use on their small children.*

### The Lost & The Found

[Go to project](lostandfound.revealnews.org)

*My first major news application project for the Center for Investigative Reporting. This application accompanied our investigation [Left for Dead](http://revealnews.org/leftfordead) which looked into the broken law enforcement systems that prevent unidentified bodies from being identified, and missing persons from being found.*

*The application took data from the NamUs databases of missing and unidentified persons and allows users to search through both databases simultaneously, hopefully making in easier for the public to assist law enforcement in making breakthroughs on cold cases. I was responsible for the design and interaction of the site.*
