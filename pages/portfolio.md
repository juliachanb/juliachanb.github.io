### Interactive: For disabled patients, an endless cycle of abuse

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/article/interactive-for-disabled-patients-an-endless-cycle-of-abuse/)

*This interactive accompanied Reveal and New Hampshire Public Radio’s [larger investigation](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/a-mountain-of-misconduct/) into the history of abuse and neglect at a network of family-run neurorehab centers. It takes a deeper look at the major players uncovered while reporting the story, and displays their connections with one another.*

*I worked with developer Julia Smith to conceptualize the design and functionality of the interactive, and artist Anna Vignet on the illustrations. I also worked closely with lead reporters Laura Starecheski and NHPR’s Jack Rodolico to write and edit the graphic's narrative. One of my goals for this project was to make sure that each character's story stood well alone and as a slice of the larger piece.*

*Bonus: An [iframed version](http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/apps-staging-cironline-org/lakeview-timeline/index.html) of the timeline was distributed to 200+ radio stations to include on their websites alongside the radio investigation.*

### The year in Reveal

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/the-year-in-reveal/)

*I produced this episode and developed the [community engagement campaign](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/hey-listeners-what-was-your-favorite-reveal-moment-of-2016/) that went into putting it together.*

*I worked with our engagement lead to seed the campaign and used the resulting listener feedback to decide which stories to discuss and/or revisit. I was then able to work their responses into the show, [online](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/reveals-most-memorable-moments-according-to-you/) and [in our newsletter](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=cb5ac439b0222506e9eb7736c&id=903814996c&e=a60d763829). I wrote the scripts and worked with our engineers to record Al and produce the episode in Pro Tools.*

### After Orlando

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/reveals-most-memorable-moments-according-to-you/)

*This show was the first time we turned around an episode in a week – and with that came quick thinking and production. We were able to memorialize the victims by using snippets of their lives found on social media as vignettes heard throughout the hour. I produced these vignettes and  coordinated with the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus to use their beautiful tribute for the top of the show.*

### New day dawning on the night shift

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/new-day-dawning-on-the-night-shift/)

*I was the lead producer on this episode and produced the updates. This production included new sound and interviews from a rally of workers, activists and legislators at the California State Capitol – an event that was sparked, in part, by Reveal's investigation [Rape on the Night Shift](https://www.revealnews.org/nightshift/); working with freelance reporter Sandra Bartlett to update her story about "[Disposable workers in Asia](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/hell-of-a-job/#segment-disposable-workers-in-asia);" and producing a new story from our partners at the Houston Chronicle which looked at a black market of undocumented workers used to supply Chinese restaurants all over the U.S.*

[Go to project](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/another-look-at-the-perilous-price-of-american-energy/)

*I was the lead producer on this episode and produced the updates. These updates included new sound and interviews from the StoryWorks play, "North by Inferno" – a stage production inspired by Reveal's investigation of North Dakota’s [Bakken oil boom](https://www.revealnews.org/article/in-north-dakotas-bakken-oil-boom-there-will-be-blood/); working with KUOW reporter Ashley to update her story about "[Tracking oil trains](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/power-struggle-the-perilous-price-of-americas-energy-boom/#segment-tracking-oil-trains);" and reaching out to reporter Michael Corey and StateImpact Oklahoma's Joe Wertz to update their investigation into man-made earthquakes.*

My role in this production was to work with the original reporters and their stories, write their scripts and produce their segments.*

### The Lost & The Found

[Go to project](lostandfound.revealnews.org)

*My first major news application project for the Center for Investigative Reporting. This application accompanied our investigation [Left for Dead](http://revealnews.org/leftfordead) which looked into the broken law enforcement systems that prevent unidentified bodies from being identified, and missing persons from being found.*

*The application took data from the NamUs databases of missing and unidentified persons and allows users to search through both databases simultaneously, hopefully making in easier for the public to assist law enforcement in making breakthroughs on cold cases. I was responsible for the design and interaction of the site.*
