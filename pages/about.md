Hi, I'm Julia! I'm a really cool journalist and DJ lady. This is a sentecne to show me how this works.

I wear cooler glasses than you, and my dog is awesome. His name is Remy and he is very fluffy. You might even get to meet him.

During the day, I split my time between a Magic Grant project with the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](http://brown.stanford.edu) and working as the Data Fellow at the [Center for Investigative Reporting](http://www.revealnews.org). Nights, I'm either teaching at [UC Berkeley](link to new media site), crushing bar trivia or "exploring" San Francisco's Mission District taquerias.

Before coming to the Bay Area, I was the editor of [PBS NewsHour Extra](http://www.newshour.pbs.org/extra), the [PBS NewsHour's](http://newshour.pbs.org) educational resources site in Arlington, Virginia. I wrote, edited and produced Extra’s content, and created multimedia assets for the NewsHour’s main online operation.

If you'd like to know more about me, check out my [resume](/resume/).
