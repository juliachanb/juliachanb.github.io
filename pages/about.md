Hey, there! I’m Julia, a multiplatform journalist, project manager and digital strategist. 

I've worked in the news industry for more than 10 years, managing and leading editorial content, story production and audience engagement for breaking news and long-form investigative work.

I'm currently the Director of Audience at Mother Jones. Previously, I was the Digital Editor at [Reveal and The Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.revealnews.org/) where I grew the organization's audiences, editorial strategy and digital offerings. 

Beyond my own newsroom, I enjoy building community and championing diversity across industries. I serve on the [Asian American Journalists Association](http://www.aaja.org/)'s national governing board and I founded [Journalists of Color](https://journalistsofcolor.us/), a global community of digitally savvy and diverse journalists. 

In February, I participated in the [Women’s Leadership Accelerator class](https://journalists.org/programs/womens-leadership-accelerator/2017-class/) organized by the Online News Association.

I live in San Francisco, drive an electric car and have a [Pomeranian sidekick](https://www.instagram.com/p/9jjoFmzRBz/?taken-by=juliachanb).

To the [résumé](/resume/)!
