Hey, there! I'm Julia, a multi-platform journalist who works and plays in the digital space. With more than 10 years of experience in the news industry, I'm well acclimated to high-pressure environments, the nonstop rhythm of news cycles, and the ebb and flow of tech trends.

I'm quick, efficient and accurate – without losing wit or creativity.

Currently, I'm the Digital Editor at [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/) and The Center for Investigative Reporting. 

This year I was elected to serve her local chapter of the [Asian American Journalists Association](http://www.aaja.org/) as President. And I'll be participating in the [2017 Women's Leadership Accelerator class](https://journalists.org/programs/womens-leadership-accelerator/2017-class/) organized by the Online News Association. 

The rest of my time will be spent growing [this community of JOCs](https://journalistsofcolor.us/), brainstorming music projects, reading short stories and (let's be honest) watching Netflix.

I live in San Francisco and drive an electric car. 

I'm aware of how clichéd that sounds.

To the [resume](/resume/)!
