Julia B. Chan is a multi-platform journalist who works and plays in the digital space. With more than 10 years of experience in the news industry, she’s well acclimated to the high-pressure environments of newsrooms, nonstop rhythms of news cycles, and the ebb and flow of tech trends.

She's quick, efficient and accurate – but not without maintaining a sense of wit and creativity.

Currently, Julia's the Digital Editor at [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/) and The Center for Investigative Reporting. 

This year she was elected to serve her local chapter of the [Asian American Journalists Association](http://www.aaja.org/) as President. And she'll be participating in the [2017 Women's Leadership Accelerator class](https://journalists.org/programs/womens-leadership-accelerator/2017-class/) organized by the Online News Association. 

The rest of her time will be spent growing [this community of JOCs](https://journalistsofcolor.us/), brainstorming music projects and (let's be honest) watching Netflix.

Julia lives in San Francisco and drives an electric car. 

She's aware of how clichéd that sounds.
