## Washington Post I-Team editor application

Please find my cover letter and work links below. 

Dear Mr. Leen, Mr. Fallis and Ms. Grant,

Close to five years ago, I joined The Center for Investigative Reporting as a reporter and digital specialist, but I had yet to learn of the discipline investigative journalism requires and the potential it represents. Over the years, I’ve developed my investigative instincts and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of telling big, important stories in accessible and creative ways. 

It’s because of this experience and enthusiasm for journalism that makes a difference that I’m applying for the assignment editor position on your rapid-response investigative team. 

In my current role as a digital editor at Reveal and The Center for Investigative Reporting, I develop and lead editorial projects that determine how stories and investigations are published across platforms. My job combines reporting and editing with multimedia production that can include audio stories, social video, text pieces, interactive graphics and, yes, even a GIF or two. 

I’m quick and efficient – but not at the expense of accuracy or creativity.

In 2016, CIR launched the Reveal radio show and podcast as a weekly production. For the newsroom that’s meant quicker-turn investigative stories across multiple platforms. For me, it’s meant working smarter. Along with traditional editing and project management duties, I’ve also established a number of workflows for our various teams.

I work with at least four teams on a daily basis: web, radio, engagement and editorial. I also collaborate with our data team when there’s a data component to our stories. 

This has meant teaming up with developers on stories like “Portraits of a Trump supporter” which integrates audio and photos collected during the reporting process, and research and analysis from the data team. For this story, I worked closely with news applications developer Scott Pham to build and design the interactive elements and Senior Data Editor Jennifer LaFleur provided the analysis.

This story was a part of a larger look at Donald Trump supporters – who they are and why they support him.

In June, the nation was stunned by the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. We decided to jump on this major story for the radio show – it would be the first time we produced an episode in less than a week. I led and coordinated our audio, digital and engagement strategies which included the production of vignettes that memorialized victims using snippets of their lives found on social media; the radio team and the data team worked together to produce a sonic memorial using data sonification, Scott and I took a look at the lone wolf phenomena using a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center; and on our social channels, we shared stories about mass shootings in America. On the community engagement front, we also worked with Hearken to seed the question, “What do you want to know about mass shootings in America?” – a campaign that is now helping us pursue audience-powered investigations.

In March, Reveal – along with the Center for Public Integrity – took an in-depth look at dark money.

In the show, host Al Letson played “The Super Pac Name Game,” a segment in which he had to guess the political affiliations of super pacs based solely on their names. The production of this inspired the digital strategy for me.

With the goal of building a holistic way to engage audience members across platforms, my teams and I produced a video that featured our staffers playing the game with a callout link that brought viewers to a quiz on our website. The quiz pointed to the episode to learn more – and the show, in turn, promoted the online quiz. So whether people were listening to the podcast, engaging on social, or landing on the quiz page, the experience was built to be connected but not redundant.

Given my experience at CIR, I’m well-acclimated to strenuous deadlines, hopping on major stories and digging deeper, faster. My previous experience at a daily newspaper – the San Francisco Examiner – also contributes to my huge appetite for journalism at a timely pace. 

The Washington Post’s tradition of excellence and groundbreaking journalism is something I aspire to. And the rapid response I saw at play in WaPo’s investigative look at Justice Scalia’s death is a great benchmark. 

I am curious to learn more about the assignment editor role on your I-Team and believe I could contribute to its success. I would welcome the chance to discuss the opportunity with you.

Thanks in advance for your time. 

Sincerely,

Julia B. Chan
